# interview-gino
Project for gino interview

This is a little game of hangman. There are still some things missing (for example better styling
and a persistent database with proper data) but it is working as intended.

To run it you have to run the Angular frontend and the Spring backend.
    Running frontend: In the frontend folder run the command "ng serve".
    Running backend: In the project main folder run the command "mvn spring-boot:run".

To connect to the frontend just go to "http://localhost:4200/" in your browser.
